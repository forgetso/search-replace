# Search and Replace Extension for Chromium based browsers

Allows you to search for text anywhere on the page and replace it with different text. For example:

- quickly correct forms in which the wrong information has been entered multiple times
- edit the text in Content Manage Systems editors such as the WordPress post editor
- edit the HTML of the page
- use regular expressions as a search term
- capture matches from the regular expressions search term and apply as part of the replacement
- save the instance of the search and replace and apply to all subsequent page visits
- match pages by regular expressions to apply rules to many different web pages

Please Note:
1. You must refresh the page or restart chrome before using.
2. Please select "Input Fields Only" if you are editing text in a text editor or form.
2. The popup will not stay open if you click elsewhere. This is a feature of Chrome.
